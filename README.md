Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Tesla Stock

Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets related to Tesla stock in order to assess the impact of social media on its stock price. We utilize the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to determine sentiment scores for each tweet, which allows us to gauge public sentiment and its potential influence on stock performance.

Project Components
Data Collection: We gather tweets related to Tesla stock using a webscraping tool called snscrape. This includes historical and real-time data, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

Preprocessing: The collected tweets are preprocessed to remove noise, such as special characters, URLs, and irrelevant information. This step ensures that the data is clean and suitable for analysis.

Sentiment Analysis: We employ the VADER NLP model to assign sentiment scores to each tweet. VADER provides a polarity score, indicating whether a tweet is positive, negative, or neutral.

Data Visualization: The sentiment scores are visualized using graphs and charts to highlight trends and patterns in public sentiment over time. These visualizations help us better understand the relationship between social media sentiment and stock price movements.

Stock Price Data: We gather historical and real-time stock price data for Tesla to compare with the sentiment analysis results. This enables us to explore correlations and potential causation between social media sentiment and stock price changes.

Statistical Analysis: Statistical tests may be performed to quantify the relationship between sentiment scores and stock price movements. This can include regression analysis to assess the impact of sentiment on stock prices.
